        <h2>Lessons you can learn from Lions</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>Don't be a sleepyhead</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          In Africa,lion is the king of the beast. Lion is a symbol of power,
          courage and strength. A lion can spend 20 hours of his day not doing
          anything at all. He sleeps a lot, seat around a lot, lying on his back
          a lot. for the other 4 hours, he eats, fathers the children and fights
          other lions that trespass on his territory. So heâ€™s a
          <em>father a fighter</em>, a <em>loafer</em>, and a
          <em>sleepyhead</em>.<br />
          One lesson we can learn is that we need to be courageous, and fight
          for our family. but we need to avoid laziness, we cannot imitate the
          lion and spend 20 hours of our time not doing anything at all, in
          other words, we cannot be a sleepyhead.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Never give up</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          When lion pick up a fight, he will never give up until he wins or
          loose. When a lion failed, he does not let his failure to bring him
          down. Since we need to be peace maker, we will not pick up a fight
          against no one, but life always throw stuffs at us that requires us to
          fight. For example the death of a loved one, chronic sickness,
          economic problems. Be like a lion, fight, fight and fight, never give
          up until you win or loose. If you loose, don't let your failure brings
          you down, get up and keep fighting.
